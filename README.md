Description:
The purpose of this program - Loco Lists App - is to accept eight, unique words from a user. The words are added
into a list. The list will be sorted, then custom sorted by word length, and then shuffled.
Next, the user will provide a search word.  The location of the word in the list will be returned, or else they
will be told the word does not exist in the list.
Using two more Collections methods, the list will be rotated and then reversed.
Lastly, the list will be converted to an array and then converted back to a list.
At the bottom of this program is a comment on the difference between Collections and Collection.
